Introduction to Version Control System with Git & GitHub

Version Control System
Version control, also known as source control or revision control, is a software development practice that tracks and manages changes to files over time. 
Version control systems (VCS) 's particularly important for things like code, documents, or any project where multiple people might be working on the same files.

How VCS works?
1. Keeps a history: Every time you make a change to a file, the VCS takes a snapshot of that version and stores it. This allows you to see how the file has changed over time and revert to a previous version if needed. 

2. Collaboration: Multiple people can work on the same files at the same time. The VCS helps to avoid conflicts by keeping track of who made which changes. 

3. Branching: You can create different branches of your project, which allows you to experiment with changes without affecting the main version.


Benefits of Using VCS :

1. Prevents data loss: If you accidentally delete something or make a mistake, you can easily revert to a previous version. 

2. Collaboration: Makes it easier for multiple people to work on the same project without conflicts. 

3. Organization: Helps you keep track of changes and see how your project has evolved over time.

Types of VCS:
1. Centralized Version Control System (CVCS):
 Here, all file versions are stored on a central server. This makes collaboration easy, but it can be a single point of failure if the server goes down.
2. Distributed Version Control System (DVCS):
 Every user has a complete copy of the entire project history on their local machine. This allows for offline work and more flexibility, with popular options like Git being DVCS.
Examples of VCS
1. Git
2. GitHub 
3. Subversion (SVN) 
4. Mercurial

1. Git Comits :
* A commit in a git repository records a snapshot of all the (tracked) files in your directory. It's like a giant copy and paste, but even better!
* Git also maintains a history of which commits were made when.

2. Git Pull :
* pull말s a combination of 2 different commands: Fetch & merge.
* It is used to pull all changes from a remote repository into the branch you are working on. That is how you keep your local Git up to date from a remote repository.

3. Git Push:
* Git push is a command used in Git version control to transfer local commits to a remote repository, typically hosted on a platform like GitHub. 
* It's like publishing your local changes and updates to a central location where others can access them.

4. Git Branch :
They allow you to create independent lines of development within your project without affecting the main codebase
* By default, you start with a single branch called master. This branch represents the main line of development for your project.
* When you use the git branch <branch_name> command, you create a new branch that diverges from the current commit on the timeline. This new branch acts like a separate working directory with its own history of commits.

GitContribute

At the heart of Git is collaboration. However, Git does not allow you to add code to someone else's repository without access rights.
In order to copy a repository, make changes to it, and suggest those changes be implemented to the original repository, follow the steps given below:

1. Fork the Repository
> A맍ork말s a copy of a repository.
> This is useful when you want to contribute to someone else's project or start your own project based on theirs.
> fork말s not a command in Git.

2. Clone a Fork from GitHub
> A맊lone말s a full copy of a repository, including all logging and versions of files.
> Move back to the맖riginalrepository, and click the green "Code" button to get theURL맚o맊lone

3. Send Pull Request

> A pull request is a formal way of proposing your changes to be merged into the main codebase of the project. 
> You'll use the GitHub interface to create a pull request, which essentially sends a notification to the maintainers about your contributions and allows them to review your code before merging it.
